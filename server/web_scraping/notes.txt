Ideas for graphs: 

1. Most common months for deaths - line graph 
2. Graph of all deaths by age - Data for this graph is done - Graph Built 
3. Top 3 deadliest expeditions - Data for this graph is ready 
4. Top 3 nationalies - Data for this graph is ready. - Graph Built 
5. Top 3 or 5 causes of death - Data for this graph is ready. 
6. Top 3 locations for deaths

Chat GPT ideas: 

Heat Maps:

Deaths per Year vs. Nationality: A heat map showing which nationalities had more deaths in which years.

Location vs. Cause of Death: A heat map showing which locations are most associated with specific causes of death.

Linear Regression: 

Age vs. Year: See if there is a trend in climbersâ€™ ages over time.

Deaths per Expedition Year: Regression of number of deaths over time to see if safety is improving.

Other Graphs: 

Time Series: Plot total deaths per year to see peaks during major expeditions.

Pie Chart or Bar Plot: Proportion of deaths by cause (avalanche, fall, exposure, etc.).

Stacked Bar: Number of deaths by nationality over time.

Map Plot: If you can geo-locate the Location, a map heat map could show dangerous spots on Everest.
