# Everest Study
## Intro

So, the other day I was talking with my coworker about deaths on Everest. I found a wikipedia link that had quite a lot of 
data for all the people who died on the mountain. I needed a new project and so I thought to myself - why not! So here we are. 

Link to site:

Steps to build project: 
1. Web scrape data 
2. Get data into a CSV file or mysql database

4. build graphs on website
