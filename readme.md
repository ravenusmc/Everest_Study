# Everest Study
## Intro

So, the other day I was talking with my coworker about deaths on Everest. I found a wikipedia link that had quite a lot of 
data for all the people who died on the mountain. I needed a new project and so I thought to myself - why not! So here we are. 

Link to site: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_died_climbing_Mount_Everest

Steps followed to build project: 
1. Web scrape data 
2. Get data into a CSV file or mysql database 
3. build a website 
4. build graphs on website

There was one graph that I made that I decided not to have in the final project. It will be found with commented out code. I 
do not believe that I'll ever be adding it back.
